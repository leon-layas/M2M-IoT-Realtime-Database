Documentation for all of the basic commands will soon be available at [phant.io/docs](http://phant.io/docs).
If you are interested in deploying your own production version of phant, we will be releasing technical documentation
in the next couple months.

If you have any specific documentation requests, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/sparkfun/phant-docs/issues).
