To create a data stream, you will need to provide a `title`, `description`, `tags`, and `fields`.  You will
also be able to choose whether or not you would like your stream to be `visible` or `hidden` from the
public stream list.

## Title

The stream title can be anything you'd like, but try to not make it too generic. For example,
*Uniontown Weather Feed* is a better title than *My Weather Station*.

## Description

The description field allows you to give a short overview of your project so others
will have an idea of what your data represents.

## Fields

Fields are the names of the variables you are posting to the server. If you are collecting weather data,
your field names would look something like `wind`, `temp`, and `rain`.  Field names must not contain spaces, and
should only include letters, numbers and underscores.

## Tags

Tags allow you to categorize your streams, and will make them easier to find when browsing through the public stream
list.  For example, if you tagged your stream with `earthquake` and `california`, your stream would be categorized
with other streams that use those specific tags.
